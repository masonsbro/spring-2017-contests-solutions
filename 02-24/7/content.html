Title: Blah

Problem statement:

A certain accountant, Mr. Bogus Von Fakename ("It's pronounced 'fah-kay-nah-may'") is
riding down a long, slow escalator one day when he looks out the window and sees a very
strange tree: a binary tree, in fact, and each branch junction has a number on it. Being a
man of numbers, he is fascinated, and writes down each number as he sees it. Since he's on
an escalator, he sees the tree in columns: left to right, then top to bottom, then left to
right. For example, if the tree was

```
            7
           / \
          /   \
         /     \
        5       11
       / \     /  \
      /   \   /    \
      3    6 9     15
            / \
           /   \
          /     10
         8
```

He would see the columns `3`, `5 8`, `7 6 9`, `11 10`, `15` in that order.

Precisely, if any node in the tree is in column $k$, its left child (if it exists) is in
column $k-1$, and its right child is in column $k+1$. Within each column, ensure nodes at
the same level are read left-to-right.

Input format:

The input starts with an integer $T$, the number of test cases, on its own line. $T$ test
cases follow.

Each test cases starts with an integer $n$, the number of entries in the tree, on its own
line. The next line contains $n$ unique integers, separated by spaces, that should form
the tree.

Output format:

For each test case, output the nodes of the tree in the order seen by Mr. Von Fakename.
