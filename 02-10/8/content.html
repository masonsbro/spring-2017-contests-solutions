<h1>Random Tickets</h1>

<p>One day, I was scheduled to fly somewhere, but I lost my plane tickets!
Luckily for me, I remember that I was traveling from airport 1 to airport N;
however, I do not remember where I was supposed to transfer flights (if at
all). To solve this problem, I decide to travel from airport 1 to airport N
with the following process. At airport u, I choose a ticket uniformly at random
(which must originate at airport u) and use it. This puts me at airport v. If
I'm not at airport N, then I repeat this process until I reach airport N. Could
you please compute the expected number of flights my trip will entail to the
nearest integer?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The first line contains an integer T (the number of test cases). T test
cases follow.</p>

<p>The first line of each test case contains integers N and M. N represents the
number of airports on my map, and M represents the number of tickets I could
possibly use. M lines follow as described.</p>

<p>On each of the subsequent M lines are two integers u, v. Each line indicates
that there exists a ticket from airport u to airport v. Each unordered pair (u,
v) is guaranteed to be listed at most once.</p>

<p>The provided graph is guaranteed to be a directed acyclic graph (in
particular, there are no cycles). Also, for each ticket t, there is guaranteed
to exist a path P from 1 to N such that P includes t.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>Output T real numbers, one on each line. The ith number should represent the
ith answer rounded to three digits after the decimal point. For example, 0.7555
rounds to 0.756, 100.10101 rounds to 100.101, and 5 would be printed as
5.000.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<pre>
1 <= T <= 10
2 <= N, M <= 100000
1 <= u, v <= N
</pre>

<h4>Sample Input</h4>

<pre>
2
5 6
1 3
1 2
3 4
2 4
3 5
4 5
2 1
1 2
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>

<pre>
2.750
1.000
</pre>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>In the first case, I have two tickets I can take from airport 1. If I fly to
airport 3, then I will have two more options: 4 and 5. If I take 5, then I'm at
my destination, and if I take 4, then I'll have to take a ticket to 5 for my
next flight. On the other hand, if I go to 2 first, then I will definitely fly
to 4 and then to 5. Taking the expected value over all of these choices, I will
reach airport 5 in 2.75 flights on average.</p>

<p>In the second case, I can only go straight to my final destination.</p>
