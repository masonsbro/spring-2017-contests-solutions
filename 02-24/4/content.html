Title: Fire Safety

Problem statement:

According to Scranton fire code, every room in an office building must have a
posted maximum occupancy. There are many ways to measure how many people can
safely be in a room, but Dwight, the landlord of a building in 1725 Slough Avenue, is only concerned that everyone can exit the office in case of a fire.

The building has $S$ staircases. Each staircase has a different congestion
factor $C_i$, which characterizes how fast people can get through the
staircase. If $P_i$ people go through a staircase with congestion $C_i$, then
it takes $P_i \times C_i$ minutes for all $P_i$ of those people to get to the
bottom of the staircase.

Dwight is trying to find the maximum number of people he can cram into each of
his offices. $P$ people can fit into an office if each person is assigned to a
staircase and the group in each staircase can get out within $T$ minutes, set by
the fire code.

Can you write a program that will help him do that? It is guaranteed that no
modern office buildings can support a number of people that will overflow a
signed 32-bit integer.

Input format:

The first line of input will contain integers $S$ and $T$, the number of
staircases in the office and the time all people must be out of the office by.
The next line contains $S$ space separated integers, the congestion $C_i$ for each
staircase.

Output format:

On the first line of output, print $P$, the maximum occupancy of the office
building. On the second line, print $S$ space separated integers, the number of
people assigned to each staircase.

The sum of the values in the second line must be equal to the number printed in
the first line.

Constraints:

$1 \leq S \leq 10^5$
$1 \leq T \leq 10^9$
$1 \leq C_i \leq 10^6$
