Title: Cupboard

Problem statement:

You need to store some building maintenance supplies, and also perhaps supply housing for
young wizards. Either way, the obvious best place is the cupboard under the stairs.
However, all the staircases in your building are different sizes, so you need to know how
much space is under each one.

Input format:

The input will consist of an integer $T$ representing the number of test (stair)cases. $T$
lines follow, each containing three integers:

* The height $h$ in inches of each step in the staircase,
* The number $n$ of each step in the staircase,
* The width $w$ in feet of each step in the staircase.

Constraints:

* $1 \le T \le 10^6$,
* $1 \le h \le 12$,
* $0 \le n \le 1000$,
* $1 \le w \le 10$.

Output format:

Output the total volume under the staircase in cubic inches, including the steps (that is,
don't worry about the volume of the steps themselves).
