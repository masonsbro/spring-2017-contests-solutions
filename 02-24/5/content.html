Title: Rail

Problem statement:

Arnav is about to walk down the stairs. Before he takes his first step, he notices that the
set of stairs also has a rail that he can slide down (see pic: http://i554.photobucket.com/albums/jj424/allbowerpower/Foyer/Foyer020b.jpg). Being the curious fellow he is, Arnav wants
to know how many different ways there are to get to the bottom of the staircase.

To get down the stairs, Arnav can choose to take a step from stair N to stair N-1, take a step from stair N to stair N-2, or slide from the rail at stair N to any stair below N or the bottom of the stairs.

Input format:

The first line of input is an integer T, the number of test cases. The first line of every test case will consist of an integer N, the number of stairs in the staircase.

Output format:

For each test case, output the number of ways Arnav can go down to the bottom of the stairs.

Sample input:
3
2
4
7

Sample output:
6
49
1169

Explanation: For the first test case, we have 2 stairs in our staircase. The total number of ways to reach the bottom of the stairs is 6, which are: 1. step step, step and skip one, step slide, slide step, slide all the way, slide slide.
