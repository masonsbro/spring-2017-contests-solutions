Title: Baby Steps

Problem statement:

Ryan has been hired by UTCS to build a staircase. It starts at ground level and
ends $M$ feet above ground level, and should be $N$ feet long. For example, the
following is a valid staircase for $N = 3$ and $M = 2$.

       XF
      XX
    GXXX

Here, we use G to denote ground level and F to denote $M$ feet above ground
level. A person about to use the staircase would be standing on top of the G,
and a person who just finished using the staircase would be standing on top of
the F.  Note that the first column after G must be at the same level as G, and
the last column must be $M$ feet higher.

However, not every step must be the same length: each step can be any integer
length. For example, the following is a valid staircase for $N = 4$ and $M =
2$.

        XF
      XXX
    GXXXX

Every step must be at an integer number of feet above or below ground level
(or, of course, at ground level), and it is okay for a step to be below the
previous step, as long as at the end the staircase ends up in the right place.
For example, the following is a valid staircase for $N = 10$ and $M = 2$. Note
that it goes below ground level.

          XX   
         XXXX XF
        XXXXXXX
    GX XXXXXXXX
     XXXXXXXXXX

Finally, a valid staircase can only use "baby steps"--that is, each step can
only be exactly 1 foot higher or 1 foot lower than the previous step.

For example, the following staircase is NOT valid:

       XF
       X
    GXXX

These are the only restrictions Ryan was given, and he wants to know how many
valid staircases he can build. Two staircases are considered different if there
exists a column in which the staircases have different heights. Note that two
valid staircases cannot differ in the first or last column, because these must
be at ground level and $M$ feet above ground level, respectively.

For example, if $N = 3$ and $M = 0$, here are the valid staircases:

    GXXXF
&nbsp;

      X
    GXXXF
&nbsp;

    GX XF
     XXX

These are all the valid staircases for $N = 3$ and $M = 0$, so the answer for
this case would be $3$. In general, the answer may be very large, so output the
remainder after dividing the number of valid staircases by $10^9 + 7$.

Input format:

The only line of input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.

Constraints:

For 40% score:

- $1 \leq N \leq 10^3$
- $0 \leq M \leq 10^3$

For 100% score:

- $1 \leq N \leq 10^6$
- $0 \leq M \leq 10^6$

Output format:

Output a single integer, the number of valid staircases Ryan can build modulo
$10^9 + 7$.
