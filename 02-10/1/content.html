<h1>Seat Numbers</h1>

<p>I was preparing to board my flight. Unfortunately, I lost my boarding card!
Of course, my biggest concern is the size of the aircraft I'm about to fly on.
I remember my seat number, however. Given my seat number, can you tell me the
minimum possible capacity of my aircraft?</p>

<p>My seat number is of the form [row number][aisle letter]. Aisles in this
aircraft are guaranteed to be labeled as A-F. There are no incomplete
aisles.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The first line contains an integer T. T lines follow. Each line contains a
string of the form [N][L].</p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>Please output T lines where the ith line contains the answer to the ith test
case.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<pre>
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 1000000000
'A' <= L <= 'F'
1 <= i <= T
</pre>

<h4>Sample Input</h4>

<pre>
3
23A
46F
1B
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>

<pre>
138
276
6
</pre>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>For the first case, there must be at least 23 rows in the aircraft, where
each row can seat 6 passengers.</p>
