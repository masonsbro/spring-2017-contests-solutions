<h1>Overbooked</h1>

<p>You're the manager of Greedy Airlines and you've recently noticed that one of your flights is overbooked (too many tickets sold, not enough seats on the plane). In order to fix this problem, you must bribe enough passengers to choose not to fly on the overbooked flight and to switch to another flight. Luckily for you, you already know the asking prices for all of the passengers!</p>

<p>Given the asking prices (the amount of money it will take to pay the passenger not to fly on the flight) for all passengers on the overbooked flight, what is the minimum amount of money that you need to spend in bribes in order to make the flight not overbooked?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases will follow. The first line of each test case will be an integer N, the number of passengers who booked the flight, and an integer M, the maximum amount of passengers allowed on the flight. The next line of each test case will contain N space-separated integers, each representing the asking price of a passenger on the flight.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>For each test case, output the minimum amount of money you will have to spend in bribes in order to have the number of passengers on the flight be less than or equal to the number of passengers allowed.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<pre>
T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10000
1 <= M <= 1000
1 <= N_i <= 100
</pre>

<h4>Sample Input</h4>

<pre>
1
3 2
4 5 2
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>

<pre>
2
</pre>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>Since we only need to remove one passenger from the flight, we can select the passenger with asking price 2, which will give us the minimum bribe cost overall (as opposed to 4 and 5).</p>
