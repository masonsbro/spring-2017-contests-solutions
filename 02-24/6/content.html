Title: Chair Race

Problem statement:

The GDC has lots of rolly chairs, and you've decided to organize a chair race!
In this race, each person will sit in a rolly chair in some start room, and
then roll their chair through a predefined sequence of rooms (connected by
doors), ending in some finish room.

You have been considering different possible routes for the race, and you've
realized that you tend to prefer routes that start and finish in the same room.
So, if such a route exists, you'd like to use it. However, to avoid confusing
the contestants, a route is only "valid" if it doesn't visit any room more than
once (except the start/finish).

The building has $N$ rooms (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ <strong>one-way
</strong> doors. Given the layout of the building, determine whether there is a
valid route that starts and ends in the same room.

Input format:

The first line contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$, the number of
rooms and one-way doors respectively. $M$ lines follow. Each of the next $M$
lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$, indicating that there is a one-way
door from room $u$ to room $v$.

Constraints:

 - $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$
 - $1 \leq M \leq 10^5$
 - $1 \leq u, v \leq N$
 - $u \neq v$

There will never be two doors that connect the same ordered pair of rooms. That
is, all doors are distinct.

Output format:

Output a single line containing "YES" if a valid route that starts and finishes
in the same room exists, or "NO" if there is no such route.
