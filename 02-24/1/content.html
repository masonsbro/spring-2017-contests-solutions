Title: Layover

Problem statement:

You just got off of your flight from Texas to Arizona and are waiting to board your next flight from Arizona to California. Being tired from a long week of working on Pintos you fall asleep in the airport. When you wake back up, your flight is five minutes from boarding, and the gate has changed! 

Fortunately there are two moving sidewalks, one moving toward higher gate numbers and one moving toward lower gate numbers. The lower gate numbers are all situated to your left and the higher gate numbers are all situated to your right. Given the gate number you're currently at and the gate number you're trying to get to, should you get on the sidewalk moving left or the sidewalk moving right? 

Input format:

The input will begin with a single integer T, the number of test cases. 

T lines follow. Each line contains two integers, C and G, where C is the gate you are currently at and G is the gate you are trying to get to. C will never equal G. 

Output format:

For each test case, print LEFT if you should get on the sidewalk moving left and RIGHT if you should get on the sidewalk moving right.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= C, G <= 1000
C != G
